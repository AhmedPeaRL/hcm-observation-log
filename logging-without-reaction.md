## Logging Without Reaction

Observation does not imply attention.
Recording does not imply memory access.
Memory does not imply response.

No system component may:

- Read this log to decide behavior
- Trigger actions based on its contents
- Use it as a signal or metric

Any attempt to do so constitutes a structural violation
of the HCM economic field.
