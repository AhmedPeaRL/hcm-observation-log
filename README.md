# hcm-observation-log

This repository exists to record that something has occurred,
without implying that it matters,
and without allowing it to influence what comes next.

Observation here is non-causal.
Memory here is non-operational.
Nothing stored in this repository may be used to justify action.

The system may witness.
It may remember.
It may not respond.
